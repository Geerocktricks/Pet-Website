    <p>Dogs are my favourite animals. I have a puppy named Gerry.</p>

      <p>Once the project is pushed to GitHub, you will be able to view it
         online at github-username.github.io/repository-name. For example,
         if our GitHub username was moringa-school-student, and our repository
          was named hello-world, we would navigate to moringa-school-student.
          github.io/hello-world in the browser.
